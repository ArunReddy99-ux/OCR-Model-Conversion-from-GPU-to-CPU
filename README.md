# OCR-Model-Conversion-from-GPU-to-CPU
This project demonstrates the conversion of an OCR model from GPU-based processing to CPU-based processing. OCR models are commonly used for extracting text from images or videos, and while GPUs provide faster inference, CPU processing might be required in environments where GPUs are unavailable or for systems with limited resources.
